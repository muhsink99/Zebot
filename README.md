# Zebot

Zebot is a Discord bot designed to handle various tasks. These primarily include: 
* Music streaming 
* OPGG stats [Just provides link, will expand on later on] 
* Displaying user information (name, date of creation, etc...) 
* As well as a bunch of random stuff like rolling a random number between 1 and 999. 

### Example case:
Suppose you use the **play** command. The bot will join the voice channel, and begin playing music; providing the user with the following feedback: 

![Feedback to user](https://i.gyazo.com/23ff0e503e24e64bc27b9257f2ec638e.png)

If the **play** command is used again whilst music is playing, it'll be queued insteadi; providing the following feedback: 

![Feedback to user 2](https://i.gyazo.com/8f1c008dc095887593dd0fda2da694b6.png)

The user can then use the **queue** to display the list of currently queue'd songs:
